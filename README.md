# Compare-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

## Introduction

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society. The data set could be found from this [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

Classification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify data. Especially in medical field, where those methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions.

In this repo it will discover how you can create a test harness to compare multiple different machine learning algorithms in Python with scikit-learn.

## Choose and Compare the Best Machine Learning Model

How do you choose the best model for your problem?. When you work on a machine learning project, you often end up with multiple good models to choose from. Each model will have different performance and characteristics.
